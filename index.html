<h1>What Makes A Good Visualization?</h1>
  <h2>Good Visualization</h2>

          <a href="https://im5.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-5-cfbeee177e9f.jpg></a>
          <p1> 
   
    This Visualization struck me as a good example because it covered the main five topics: Truthful, Function, Beautiful, Insightful,
    and Enlightening. The visualization depicts accuate information with plenty data and research to prove its point. Functionality is 
    key to a good design, and the purpose of the visualization informs the audience of food waste sufficiently. Eye-Catching is what draws
    the intended audience in to observe the visualization, and more importantly incorporate the information. Furthermore, after reading 
    the information then the audience is informed about food waste, or the data supporting it. Lastly, the visualization creates a feeling
    of change or movement to take action and fix the problem presented.

 <h2>Bad Visualization</h2>
   
 <p2>
 On the other hand, this visualization is not effective because of its lack of design. Resulting in a lack of distributing the information 
 which confuses the audience, and they cannot understand the message being conveyed.
